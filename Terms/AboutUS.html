        Pedal Buddy is a biking app that provides biking trails within a 160 km radius from South African cities. Currently,
         it offers biking trails for the prominent cities in South Africa, including Cape Town, Johannesburg, and Durban, with plans to add more cities in the future.
         The data is user-generated, so some information may be inaccurate. If you want to provide more information or suggest other biking trails, y
         ou can get in touch with the developer. The app aims to provide information about biking trails such as distance, difficulty, elevation, level, descriptions, features, and
         directions, along with a map route of the biking trail if available.
     </p>

     <p>
  While efforts are made to have updated information, this is not always possible.
  The app is currently only available for iOS users, but support for other devices will be available in the future.
